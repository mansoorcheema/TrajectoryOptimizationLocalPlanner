# TrajectoryOptimizationLocalPlanner
3D Voxels and Semantics based continous motion planner for Autonomous Driving. Uses 3D pointcloud and segmentation to create Voxels with semantic and sign distance field information and generate eucledean sign distance from voxel distance while using it to optimize a ploynomial based trajectory optimization problem. The Geometric data can be obtained using Lidar data along with RGB camera images to combine geometric information like vehicles and sematic information like lanes, road surface for planning safe and efficient paths.
